// "Consider a rectangle divided into squares, like a checkerboard or chessboard. 
// One square is marked as the hole. Another square is marked start, and a third square is marked finish. 
// We will call the result a board. 

// Place a spider on the start square. The spider can step to an adjacent square on the board: north, south,
// east, west, or any of the four diagonal directions. It does this repeatedly until it reaches the finish square.
// A way of doing this that does not step on the hole, and steps on each other square exactly once, 
// is a holey spider walk." (Glenn G. Chappell)
